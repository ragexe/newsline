 *
 * Own class exception, inherited from Exception
  * In order to abstract from the data store. Ie, in this situation, if I did not use PersistException,
  * It would be caught SQLException. But the data could be stored and not in MYSQL. And if I started to work with other
  * Database, it would have to refactor a lot of code to just catch exceptions of another type.
  * Therefore, in general, use the classes in the package java.sql unified classes and interfaces is not highly desirable.
  * Use your own exceptions PersistException allows not to tie SqlException.
